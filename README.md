Morin Lab Scripts
=================

This repository serves to consolidate scripts for shared use in the Morin lab. Each script is housed in a separate subdirectory, which contains all related files, if applicable. 

To reduce redundant code, commonly used methods are added to a module in the `modules` subdirectory. Accordingly, users should add the path of this `modules` directory to their `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. 

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/lab_scripts/modules:$PYTHONPATH
