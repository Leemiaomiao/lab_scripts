Run ccf.R to calculate CCF without accounting for LOH. 

Run ccf_loh.R to calculate CCF while accounting for LOH. This gives an output similar to ccf.R.

directories.txt defines the locations of the input data files and designates the output text file locations and file names. This file is required by ccf.R and ccf_loh.R



*.R scripts assume location of directories.txt in “projects/dlbcl_relapse_exome/ccf/directories.txt”
